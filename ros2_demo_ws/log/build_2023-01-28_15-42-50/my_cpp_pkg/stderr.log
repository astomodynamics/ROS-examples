CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/tomo/Documents/ae7785-intro-to-robo/ros2_demo_ws/build/my_cpp_pkg/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/tom/Documents/github_projects/ros-ws/build/my_cpp_pkg where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/tomo/Documents/ae7785-intro-to-robo/ros2_demo_ws/src/my_cpp_pkg/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/tom/Documents/github_projects/ros-ws/src/my_cpp_pkg/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
